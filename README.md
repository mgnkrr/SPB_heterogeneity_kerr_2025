The primary analysis scripts used in this work are bootstrap_ghf_component_weighted.m, make_synthetic_GHF_MCMC_new.m, and plot_metrics_vs_modelcval_with CI.m

They rely on many functions which build the data file gmin_data.mat. This data file contains all GHF and uncertainty datasets, as well as radar and environmental data, correction files, and masks.
